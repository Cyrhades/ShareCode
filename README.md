ShareCode
=========

ShareCode provides a ready-to-use live code sharing tool written in PHP &amp; JS without the need of any specific installation or database.

Installation
------------

Just copy/paste ShareCode directory wherever from you want to use it,
or `git clone https://github.com/ivangabriele/ShareCode.git`.

Depending on your rights under Linux, you may have to change them to allow writting under the `codes/` directory.

Usage
-----

Just go to `http://[...]/ShareCode/` and you'll be automatically redirected to `http://[...]/ShareCode/XXX`, XXX being an automatically generated slug that you give to others to allow them watching your code "live" as you type it.

The first to use the slug is the "administrator" one : only him can change the code. Others can only watch and copy it.
