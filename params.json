Others can only watch and copy it.\r\n\r\nReleases Notes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### v1.2.0\r\n* CodeMirror v4 to v5\r\n* Autofocus when user is admin\r\n* Better code optimization and logic (less variables and parameters)\r\n* Tabulations indentation replaced by indentation with spaces (2)\r\n* Lose focus when \"escape\" key is pressed\r\n* Auto-clean all code files older than 7 days\r\n* Slug is now shown in the page title\r\n* A favicon (yeah I know...)\r\n\r\n### v1.1.0\r\n* Safer server-side AJAX files (managing wrong slug and no existing file)\r\n* Complete reorganization of JS And PHP Ajax files\r\n* Better code optimization and logic\r\n* No more \"last character\" issue with fast-typing code (client-server double parameters comparison instead of one)\r\n* Usage of jquery-min instead of jquery (to lighten the global size)\r\n* Many more comments\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
